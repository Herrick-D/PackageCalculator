# PackageCalculator
This an app I made for a local small business to calculate individual pre-tax prices of items that were priced as a bundle

To download just the app, go into the dist folder and download the program for your OS.

Feel free to download the whole thing and extend it for your purposes if you want.
This is a python program, so to make the program into an executable: 
  1) Install pyinstaller from a Command Line using 'pip install pyinstaller'
  2) Then use the command 'pyinstaller --onefile PackageCalculator.py'
